  A todo app made using HTMX and Go

### 🤔 Why?

I stumbled upon some videos covering htmx and got interested. Turns out it is often paired with Go, which I'm learning, so I decided to give it a try! \
Besides lack of tutorials on htmx it was an average experience overall. I learned that it would be the best to stick to react and other mainstream frameworks. 😃 \
_(I still love Go tho! 💗)_
